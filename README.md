# A*-search

"I have tried to implement this algorithm in the most simple way which anyone can understand."
"I have attached the article related to this you can go through it before proceeding. "
"Hope you r going to like this....."


         Introduction:

The A* Algorithm is a best-first search algorithm that finds the least cost path
from an initial configuration to a final configuration.The most essential part
of the A* Algorithm is a good heuristic estimate function. This can improve
the efficiency and performance of the algorithm.It is an extension of Dijkstra.s
algorithm.A* algorithm uses the function f(n) = g(n) + h(n).
* f(n) = g(n) + h(n).
* g(n) is the path-cost function, which is the cost from the starting node to
the current node.
* h(n) is the heuristic estimate of the distance to the goal.
A* Algorithm guides an optimal path to a goal if the heuristic function h(n)
is admissible.In this projct I am going to implement the algorithm using c++ .

        Applications:
        
The Real time applications of A* Algorithm are:
• A* mainly used in Computer Gaming, Robotics and Google maps.
• The A* for hueristic search is applied to construct a Neural Network struc-
ture(NS).
